I have used this website to test my query 
https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/trymysql.asp?filename=trysql_editor

SELECT
    basic.CustomerID,
    CASE
        WHEN MOD(basic.CustomerID, 2) = 1 AND basic.CustomerID != (SELECT MAX(CustomerID) FROM Customers) THEN
            (SELECT c1.CustomerName FROM Customers c1 WHERE c1.CustomerID = basic.CustomerID + 1)
        WHEN MOD(basic.CustomerID, 2) = 0 THEN
            (SELECT c2.CustomerName FROM Customers c2 WHERE c2.CustomerID = basic.CustomerID - 1)
        ELSE
            basic.CustomerName
    END AS student
FROM
    Customers basic;


The table name insdie the database in the wb3school website is called "Customers" it has many columns i used two only "CustomerID" and "CustomerName"
